2/3/25, 11:00 AM - Zara: alright team we need to lock in the big product decisions today, no more back and forth
2/3/25, 11:02 AM - Kiran: let's start with the payment provider, we've been stuck on this
2/3/25, 11:04 AM - Marcus: we looked at Stripe and Paddle both, I'd go with Stripe, documentation is miles better
2/3/25, 11:06 AM - Tanya: Stripe also has better developer tooling and we can test locally easily
2/3/25, 11:08 AM - Zara: ok we'll use Stripe for all payment processing, full stop
2/3/25, 11:10 AM - Kiran: I'll set up the Stripe integration and webhook handlers this week
2/3/25, 11:12 AM - Marcus: for the launch date, the plan is to go live on March 1st
2/3/25, 11:14 AM - Tanya: that's 4 weeks from now, very tight but doable if we cut scope
2/3/25, 11:16 AM - Zara: we've decided March 1st is the hard launch date, it does not move
2/3/25, 11:18 AM - Marcus: I will draft the go-to-market email sequence today
2/3/25, 11:20 AM - Kiran: for the MVP feature set, let's go with auth, dashboard, and exports only
2/3/25, 11:22 AM - Tanya: I propose we cut the analytics module entirely from the MVP scope
2/3/25, 11:24 AM - Zara: I think we should cut analytics and the mobile view too, keep it lean
2/3/25, 11:26 AM - Marcus: agreed on cutting both, we ship them in v2 post-launch
2/3/25, 11:28 AM - Kiran: decision: MVP scope is auth, dashboard, and data exports only, nothing else
2/3/25, 11:30 AM - Tanya: I'll handle all the dashboard UI components and layout
2/3/25, 11:32 AM - Zara: can you set up the CI/CD pipeline Marcus
2/3/25, 11:33 AM - Marcus: I'll take care of that by end of this week
2/3/25, 11:36 AM - Kiran: for hosting, we're using Vercel for frontend and Railway for the backend API
2/3/25, 11:38 AM - Tanya: please review the API contracts before anyone starts building against them
2/3/25, 11:40 AM - Zara: I will review and share feedback by Tuesday
2/3/25, 11:42 AM - Marcus: action item: Tanya to complete the full auth flow by February 14th
2/3/25, 11:44 AM - Tanya: on it, will have a PR up by Thursday this week
2/3/25, 11:47 AM - Kiran: we should do a full internal demo dry run before launch to catch anything broken
2/3/25, 11:49 AM - Zara: let's do the dry run on February 26th, that gives a week buffer before March 1st
2/3/25, 11:51 AM - Marcus: I'll book a calendar slot for everyone for the 26th
2/3/25, 11:53 AM - Tanya: for pricing, we're going with a freemium model, free tier plus paid pro
2/3/25, 11:55 AM - Zara: we settled on 29 dollars per month for the pro tier, that's the number
2/3/25, 11:57 AM - Kiran: I will set up the pricing page and billing portal on the website
2/3/25, 11:59 AM - Marcus: we're going with Product Hunt for the main launch announcement
2/3/25, 12:01 PM - Zara: all agreed, we launch on Product Hunt on March 1st at 12:01 AM
2/3/25, 12:03 PM - Tanya: I'll coordinate with the PH community manager this week to get it scheduled
2/3/25, 12:05 PM - Kiran: need you to send the press kit and screenshots to the journalist contacts Marcus
2/3/25, 12:07 PM - Marcus: I'll get that sent by Wednesday
2/3/25, 12:09 PM - Zara: we're doing a soft beta with 20 users before launch, let's go ahead with that this week
2/3/25, 12:11 PM - Kiran: I will reach out to the beta list and send onboarding emails today
2/3/25, 12:13 PM - Tanya: would you be able to write up the beta feedback form Zara
2/3/25, 12:14 PM - Zara: I'll take care of the feedback form and send it to the group for review first
2/3/25, 12:16 PM - Marcus: the plan is to collect beta feedback by February 20th so we have time to act on it
2/3/25, 12:18 PM - Kiran: going ahead with the launch plan as discussed, locking it in now
2/5/25, 2:00 PM - Zara: team, we have a problem. March 1st is not realistic anymore
2/5/25, 2:02 PM - Kiran: what happened
2/5/25, 2:03 PM - Zara: Stripe integration is more complex than expected, Kiran can you give us a status
2/5/25, 2:05 PM - Kiran: webhooks are working but the subscription billing flow has edge cases that need another week minimum
2/5/25, 2:07 PM - Tanya: auth flow also has an unresolved issue with session refresh on mobile browsers
2/5/25, 2:09 PM - Marcus: if we ship broken billing that's worse than shipping late
2/5/25, 2:11 PM - Zara: agreed. we've decided to push the launch date to March 10th, that's the new hard date
2/5/25, 2:13 PM - Kiran: I will have the Stripe billing flow fully tested and production-ready by March 7th
2/5/25, 2:15 PM - Tanya: I'll fix the session refresh bug by end of this week
2/5/25, 2:17 PM - Marcus: I'll update all the launch comms and the Product Hunt draft to reflect March 10th
2/5/25, 2:19 PM - Zara: the dry run is now moving to March 8th instead of the 26th
2/5/25, 2:21 PM - Kiran: I'll rebook the calendar slot for everyone for the 8th
2/5/25, 2:23 PM - Marcus: do we need to update the beta users on the new timeline
2/5/25, 2:25 PM - Zara: yes, I will send a note to the beta cohort today letting them know
2/5/25, 2:27 PM - Tanya: also we should revisit pricing, 29 dollars feels high for an unproven product
2/5/25, 2:29 PM - Marcus: I'd go with 19 dollars to start, easier sell for early adopters
2/5/25, 2:31 PM - Kiran: I think we should go with 19 dollars and raise it post-launch once we have testimonials
2/5/25, 2:33 PM - Zara: we settled on 19 dollars per month for the pro tier at launch, we revisit at 100 customers
2/5/25, 2:35 PM - Tanya: I will update the pricing page and Stripe product config to reflect 19 dollars
2/5/25, 2:37 PM - Marcus: the plan is to still go with Product Hunt on launch day, just now March 10th
2/5/25, 2:39 PM - Zara: all agreed. revised launch is March 10th, Product Hunt, 19 dollars pro tier
2/5/25, 2:41 PM - Kiran: going ahead with the updated launch plan, locking it in now
