2/3/25, 11:04 AM - Marcus: we looked at Stripe and Paddle both, I'd go with Stripe, documentation is miles better
2/3/25, 11:06 AM - Tanya: Stripe also has better developer tooling and we can test locally easily
2/3/25, 11:08 AM - Zara: ok we'll use Stripe for all payment processing, full stop
2/3/25, 11:10 AM - Kiran: I'll set up the Stripe integration and webhook handlers this week
2/3/25, 11:12 AM - Marcus: for the launch date, the plan is to go live on March 1st
2/3/25, 11:14 AM - Tanya: that's 4 weeks from now, very tight but doable if we cut scope

2/3/25, 11:18 AM - Marcus: I will draft the go-to-market email sequence today
2/3/25, 11:20 AM - Kiran: for the MVP feature set, let's go with auth, dashboard, and exports only
2/3/25, 11:22 AM - Tanya: I propose we cut the analytics module entirely from the MVP scope
2/3/25, 11:24 AM - Zara: I think we should cut analytics and the mobile view too, keep it lean
2/3/25, 11:26 AM - Marcus: agreed on cutting both, we ship them in v2 post-launch
2/3/25, 11:28 AM - Kiran: decision: MVP scope is auth, dashboard, and data exports only, nothing else

2/3/25, 11:47 AM - Kiran: we should do a full internal demo dry run before launch to catch anything broken
2/3/25, 11:49 AM - Zara: let's do the dry run on February 26th, that gives a week buffer before March 1st

2/3/25, 11:53 AM - Tanya: for pricing, we're going with a freemium model, free tier plus paid pro
